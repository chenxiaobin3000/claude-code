 * /usage — unified command replacing /cost and /stats (v2.1.118 upstream alignment).
 *
 * Routing:
 *   - claude.ai subscriber → Settings panel → Usage tab (plan limits + overages)
 *   - API / non-subscriber  → Stats panel (session cost, token counts, activity)
 *
 * Both /cost and /stats are registered as aliases of this command so that
 * existing muscle-memory still works.
